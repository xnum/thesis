  \hspace{0.6cm} Symbolic execution is a technology that is often used today in program automation testing and analysis. Since symbol execution traces and simulates all possible paths when a program executes, its number grows exponentially. This problem is called the path explosion problem. Therefore, we need to take some strategies within the limited resources to give priority to the more valuable path. In this paper, we propose to use The Carlo search tree-based search strategy solves this problem and compares it with other classic strategies such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
